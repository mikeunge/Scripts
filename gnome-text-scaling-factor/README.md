# gnome-text-scaling-factor

> Change the __text (_font_) scaling factor__ on the fly for _gnome_ systems.

## About

This script was created because I have some scaling/performance issues on my 32" 4k monitor at home and the 24" 1920p monitor setup at work.
With this script, I simply can change the (font-) scaling factor.

### Commands

__Tested on: _Ubuntu 22.04___

- ```text-scaling-factor help``` -> prints help(_-ing_) information
- ```text-scaling-factor up``` -> changes the scaling factor to __1.5__ (_upscaling for 4k monitor_)
- ```text-scaling-factor down``` -> changes the scaling factor to __1.0__ (_downscaling for 1920p monitor_)

## Installation

Simply run the ```install.sh``` script (_needs root privileges!_).
