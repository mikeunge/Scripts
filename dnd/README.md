# DND

__DND (_Do Not Disturb_) is a small script that disables notifications for ubuntu or any other system that uses the gnome notifier.__

## Why

I like to have my peace, so a script that lets me disable notifications is quite nice. Also I needed a way to disable notifications on (time based-) events.
